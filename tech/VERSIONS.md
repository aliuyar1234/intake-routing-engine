# Pinned versions

Pinned versions are chosen to support deterministic builds and repeatable audits.

- Python: 3.12
- jsonschema: 4.25.1
- PyYAML: 6.0.3

Operational tooling versions are environment-specific and must be captured in deployment manifests.

Canonical spec version is defined in `spec/00_CANONICAL.md`.
